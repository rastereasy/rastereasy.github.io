Introduction
============

**Overview**

**Rastereasy** is a Python library for simple manipulation of georeferenced images (`*.tif`, `*.jp2`, `*.shp`, ...).

The goal is to simplify geospatial workflows by offering tools for:

- Reading and processing raster and vector files.

- Resampling, cropping, reprojecting, stacking, ... raster images.

- Creating visualizations such as color composites and spectral analyses.

- Use (train / apply) some classical Machine Learning algorithms.

- Provide some tools for late fusion of classifications (Dempster-Shafer).

- ...




**Example Use Case**

Here is a quick overview of what you can do with rastereasy:

.. code-block:: python

   import rastereasy
   # Load a georeferenced image
   image = rastereasy.Geoimage("example.tif")

   # Get image information
   image.info()

   # Create a color composite
   image.colorcomp(['4', '3', '2'])

   # Resample and reproject
   image_resampling = image.resampling(2)
   image_reprojected = image.reproject("EPSG:4326")

   # Save the processed image
   image.save("processed_image.tif")
