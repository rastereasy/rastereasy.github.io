🚀 Rastereasy
=============

**Rastereasy** is a Python library designed for simple and efficient manipulation of georeferenced images (`*.tif`, `*.jp2`, `*.shp`, ...).

It aims to streamline geospatial workflows by providing intuitive tools for:

- Reading and processing raster and vector files.
- Resampling, cropping, reprojecting, stacking, and more.
- Creating visualizations (e.g., color composites, interactive spectral plots).
- Training and applying classical Machine Learning algorithms.
- Performing late fusion of classifications (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory).
